git clean is used to clean change that are untracked
called without flag won't delete anyhting becaouse of safety measure
following flags are available:
-n displays whatt files would be deleted
-nd display what files and folders would be deletd
-idf - is used to clean with few optional commands that are shown in terminal

git reset reverses git add, can also allow to go back to specific git state
-mixed, everything after commit that we went to is deleted
-soft, commit after the one we have visited to are added to staging area
-hard

git checkout -- fileName deletes all the changes from a modified file that isn't
in stagin area
--(hash of previous repository state) allows to go to choosen repository state
git rm fileName removes file from repositorium, if specific file name is added after hash only the data in that
path will be added to our current git repository
--nameOfBranch switches to a differnet branch

git log allows to see history of git repository changes
flags:
-oneline (filename) -(number) shows history in very condensed form, number specifies how many commits we want to see,
filename allows to see only commits that changed specific file, we can add --patch,--summary,stat with filename to show specific changes
--author="NAME" all the commit by author with name NAME
--grap="text" all commits including word 'text' in ther commit message
--format used to specifiy in what format we want our hashes to be
git revert (log hash) reverses commit of specific log as a new commit
git shortlog shows commit made by each person

git commit -m 'commitName' this command can also be used without -m flag which would usually open a text editor in which we
can specify both name and description of our commit.

git stash (push -m 'MESSAGE') without push command it can allow us to store changes made in one of the branches,
for example when we've made changes in a branch we didn't want and then after switching to correct branch we can we can use
git stash pop to add those changes to current branch. Adding (push -m 'Message') works very similiarily to pure git stash command but adds commit to the stash

git stash apply add changes to stash but doesn't delete them in current branch
git stash drop (stashIdentifier) clears specifies stash identifier
git stash clear clears whole stash
